Optimization is more than just mathematics—it's a way of thinking about life and design.

## The Core Principle

At its heart, optimization asks: *Given constraints, what is the best we can achieve?* This question applies equally to mechanical structures and to how we live our lives.

## Engineering Lessons

In topology optimization, we often discover that nature had the right answer all along. The patterns that emerge from mathematical optimization mirror what we see in bones, trees, and other natural structures.

This teaches us humility and reveals a deeper truth: efficiency and elegance are often the same thing.

## Application to Life

Just as we optimize structures by removing unnecessary material, we can optimize our lives by removing unnecessary complexity. The question isn't "What more can I add?" but "What can I remove while maintaining strength?"
