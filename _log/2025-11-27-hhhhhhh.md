what you did not do as you brieɻy thought of
Mindik as a leader. You did not start by asking, “What would I
need to know before I formed an opinion about the quality of
someone’s leadership?” System 1 got to work on its own from the
ɹrst adjective: intelligent is good, intelligent and strong is very
good. This is the best story that can be constructed from two
adjectives, and System 1 delivered it with great cognitive ease.
The story will be revised if new information comes in (such as
Mindik is corrupt), but there is no waiting and no subjective
discomfort. And there also remains a bias favoring the ɹrst
impression.

The combination of a coherence-seeking System 1 with a lazy
System 2 implies that System 2 will endorse many intuitive
beliefs, which closely reɻect the impressions generated by System
1. Of course, System 2 also is capable of a more systematic and
careful approach to evidence, and of following a list of boxes that
must be checked before making a decision—think of buying a
home, when you deliberately seek information that you don’t
have. However, System 1 is expected to inɻuence even the more
careful decisions. Its input never ceases.
Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is so
important to an understanding of intuitive thinking, and comes
up so often in this book, that I will use a cumbersome
abbreviation for it: WYSIATI, which stands for what you see is all
there is. System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and
the quantity of the information that gives rise to impressions and
intuitions.
Amos, with two of his graduate students at Stanford, reported a
study that bears directly on WYSIATI, by observing the reaction
of people who are given one-sided evidence and know it. The
participants were exposed to legal scenarios such as the
following:
On September 3, plaintiʃ David Thornton, a forty-threeyear-old union ɹeld representative, was present in Thrifty
Drug Store #168, performing a routine union visit. Within
ten minutes of his arrival, a store manager confronted him
and told him he could no longer speak with the union
