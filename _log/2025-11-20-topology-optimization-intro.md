Topology optimization is a computational method that finds the optimal material distribution within a design space.

## What You'll Need

- Basic understanding of FEA (Finite Element Analysis)
- A computational framework (MATLAB, Python, or similar)
- Patience—optimization takes time

## The Algorithm

The most common approach is the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) method:

1. Start with a uniform material distribution
2. Analyze the structure under loads
3. Update material distribution based on sensitivity
4. Repeat until convergence

## Real-World Applications

Topology optimization is used in:
- Aerospace component design
- Automotive parts
- Architecture and structural design
- 3D printing optimization

The key is understanding your constraints and objectives clearly before starting the optimization process.
